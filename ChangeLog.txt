1.03.05 (unofficial)
* NEW: task "copy" extending the standard Ant copy task with "preserveexecutable" attribute
  allowing the user to preserve execute permissions when copying files (Java 6+ and Ant 1.8.2+ required):
  <fl:copy file="foo" tofile="bar" preserveexecutable="true"/>

1.03.04 (unofficial)
* NEW: EL method invocation support:
  <echo>#{ 'foo'.toUpperCase().replaceAll('FOO', 'BAR') } == BAR</echo>
* NEW: file.tounix property:
  <echo>#{ 'C:\\Windows\\System32'.tofile.tounix } == C:/Windows/System32</echo>
* UPDATE: string.tofile property now resolves relative paths using project.resolveFile(string) 
  instead of new File(project.getBaseDir(), string) to be consistent with Ant
  
1.03.03 (unofficial)
* BUGFIX: String-to-boolean conversion to accept "true", "yes" and "on" (case-insensitive) as true:
  <property name="some_property" value="true"/>
  <fl:when test="some_property"> <!-- evaluates to true now -->
    ...
* Removed some obsolete code
  
1.03.02 (unofficial)
* NEW: Flaka is now able to see Ant local properties:
  <local name="local_property"/>
  <property name="local_property" value="test"/>
  <echo>#{local_property}</echo>
  
1.03.01 (unofficial)
* BUGFIX: Issue 21:	Lists born from split() seem to have zero size() [https://code.google.com/p/flaka/issues/detail?id=21]
  
1.03.00 (unofficial)
* BUGFIX: Issue 19:	Flaka impacts default Ant task local [http://code.google.com/p/flaka/issues/detail?id=19]
* BUGFIX: All whitespace-only strings are be converted to empty strings, so that
  <pathconvert pathsep=" "...
  becomes
  <pathconvert pathsep=""...
  
1.02.01
* [http://code.google.com/p/flaka/issues/detail?id=4] rebuilding flaka with
Ant 1.8 to avoid PropertyHelper12.class problem. No changes in source code.
Patch counter bumped to avoid confusion.
* build.xml: updated to generate Java 1.5 compatible code
* build.xml: use package-dist to generate a release build. Ensures that 1.8
  is used. Would be better though to test that all class files are packaged. 
  
1.02.00
* updated to JUEL 2.2.1 (was 2.1.1-rc4)
* using ant-antunit (1.1) to run Ant based unit tests
* refactoring ant unit tests (test/test-*.xml) 
* <switch /> redesigned to have elements re, glob, cmp and matches, attributes find, not and literally
(legacy, deprecated)
* fixed bug in <switch/matches[glob]/> to avoid partial matches.
* new distributable "ant-flaka-bare-${version}.jar" introduced - does
not contain any inlined dependencies (as ant-flaka-${version}.jar) does.
* <trycatch /> extended with <else /> clause (warning: conflicting exceptions)
